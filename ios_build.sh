# This will configure cmake build.  After this step, open the project in XCode and you may need to make some changes for the build time:
#1. Build Settings -> Other Linker Flags - make sure has the file names as liblbfgs for @rpath
#2. PROJECT LEVEL - Build Settings - Build Active Architecture Only - NO
#3. Build liblbfgs
#4. Open build-os folder containing dylib in Finder
#5. Drag and drop the dylib in XCode (Do not copy) to you target app project

#7. Make sure these are findable - Build Settings of the specific target - Header and Library Search Paths include recursive references to the header folder src and build-ios folder of the sentencepiece
